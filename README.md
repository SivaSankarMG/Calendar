# Custom Calendar Project

## Description
This is a simple calendar project implemented in Python without using any built-in libraries. It employs custom mathematical logic and basic concepts such as conditional statements, control statements, and user-defined functions to display a particular month or a whole year based on user input.

## Features
- Display a specific month of a given year.
- Display the entire calendar for a given year.
- Uses only fundamental Python concepts without relying on external libraries.


## Example
When prompted, you can enter a specific year (e.g., `2024`) and a specific month (e.g., `JUL` for July) to display the calendar for that month, or just enter the year to display the whole calendar for that year.

## Custom Logic
This project avoids using Python's built-in date and time libraries, instead relying on custom mathematical logic to calculate the days of the week and the layout of the calendar. This approach demonstrates the underlying principles of how calendars work and enhances problem-solving skills in Python.
